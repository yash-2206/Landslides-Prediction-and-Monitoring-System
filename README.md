# Landslide Prediction and Monitoring System

## Overview
Landslides are one of the most devastating natural disasters, causing significant loss of life and property worldwide. Traditional landslide monitoring systems often rely on manual observations and ground-based sensors, which can be limited in scope and effectiveness. This project leverages the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide a real-time, efficient, and accurate landslide prediction and monitoring system.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Utilizes a network of sensors to monitor soil moisture, rainfall intensity, ground displacement, and seismic activity.
- **Edge Computing:** Processes and pre-processes collected data on edge devices to reduce bandwidth requirements.
- **Machine Learning:** Employs machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data and identify patterns indicative of potential landslides.
- **Cloud Integration:** Uses cloud computing platforms to store, analyze, and visualize data.
- **GIS Integration:** Integrates geographical information systems (GIS) for effective visualization and risk assessment.

## Components
- **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module:** Facilitates wireless communication.
- **Arduino UNO:** Acts as the central processing unit for sensor data collection and pre-processing.
- **Moisture Meter:** Measures soil moisture levels.
- **Rain Sensor (FC-37):** Monitors rainfall intensity.
- **Vibration Sensor (SW-420):** Detects ground vibrations.
- **ThingSpeak Cloud Platform:** Stores and visualizes collected data.

## Installation
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the ESP8266, Arduino UNO, Moisture Meter, Rain Sensor, and Vibration Sensor according to the provided interfacing diagram.
2. **Software Setup:**
   - Install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Add the ESP8266 board to the Arduino IDE by following the instructions [here](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html).
   - Download and install the necessary libraries: `ESP8266WiFi`, `ThingSpeak`, and any sensor-specific libraries.
3. **ThingSpeak Setup:**
   - Create a ThingSpeak account and set up a new channel to receive data from your IoT devices.
   - Note the `Channel ID` and `Write API Key` for your ThingSpeak channel.

## Usage
1. **Programming the Arduino:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided sketch.
   - Update the WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak API key in the sketch.
   - Upload the sketch to the Arduino UNO.
2. **Monitoring Data:**
   - Data from the sensors will be transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform.
   - Use the ThingSpeak dashboard to visualize real-time data and historical trends.
   - Set up alerts and notifications based on specific thresholds.
